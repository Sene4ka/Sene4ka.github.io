        <h1 class="what__title">What is online radio and why is it needed?</h1>
        <p>
          Online radio has revolutionized the way we consume audio content. With
          just a click or a tap, listeners can access a diverse array of music,
          talk shows, news, and podcasts from around the globe. Unlike
          traditional radio, online radio offers a virtually limitless selection
          of stations catering to every taste and interest
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're into pop, rock, jazz, classical, or any other genre or
          even podcasts, there's an online radio station for you. Online radio
          also provides opportunities for independent artists and niche genres
          to reach a wider audience
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the convenience of online radio cannot be overstated.
          It's accessible anytime, anywhere, whether you're at home, work, or on
          the go. With mobile apps and streaming services, listeners can enjoy
          their favorite stations on smartphones, tablets, or computers with an
          internet connection
        </p>
        <p class="what__p__bolded">
          We will teach you how to create an attractive online radio for users
          and the right website for search engines and advise you on how to get
          it to the first pages, beating all competitors.
